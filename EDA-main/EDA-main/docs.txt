SCATTER PLOT
if the variable on x axis and y axis are correlated it will have a straight line or if it dont have straight line then it is not correlated.
more it is tighten more the coorelation
IT is Used when:
Dependent variable have multiple values for each value of independent variable.
to determine two variable are related.

distribution Plot
Here we are using distplot which is mixture of histogram, kdeplot and rugplot 
rugplot is like a histogram but in 1d
skewness show if it normally distributed aur it is skewed or tilted. positive or negative shows if it is rightway skewed or leftway skewed.
kurtosis: if the tail is shorter and flatter than the normal distribution than it is called positive kurtosis.
negative is vice versa and at zero it behaves has a normal distribution
